# Hells Pass - A Unity game
 A Platformer created while at university

## Abstract for Hell’s Pass
The player must make use of skilled movement and their ability to carry certain objects to make it 
through 6 challenges across a river of lava. Other than beating the game, the overarching goal is the 
beat it as fast as possible, with the fastest time being saved and displayed on the main menu and in 
game.
### Build note
The game is built on the Windows platform

## Instructions 
### Controls
• [WASD] -Movement \
• [Mouse] - Look around\
• [Space] - Jump \
• [Shift] - Run / Boost (mid-air) \
• [Mouse Left] - Hold object / Interact \
• [Mouse Right] - Throw held object \
• [Escape] -Pause

### Tips
In the case of any challenge involving manipulating objects, falling in lava will reset them, which can 
be used if they are misplaced. Objects that can be manipulated will all be found in large open 
containers.

The user interface will display information on the challenge/obstacle the player is currently facing.

The checkpoints are spires with bright red lights. On them is a button that can be clicked on to save 
the user position and thus the checkpoint. When the user accesses the checkpoint, the lights on it
will go green and a buzzer sound will play. The player must access every checkpoint to win the game.

#### Endgame
When the player presses the last checkpoint, the end game screen will appear. If the player has 
beaten the current high score, a special message will be displayed. The player is then free to return 
to the main menu or explore the map via a bridge across the lava that will have appeared.
